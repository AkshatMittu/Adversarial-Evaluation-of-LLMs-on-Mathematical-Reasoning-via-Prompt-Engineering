      "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, there are two trains of equal length, each 120 meters. The first train takes 10 seconds to cross a telegraph post, and the second takes 20 seconds. The question is, how long will it take for them to cross each other when moving in opposite directions?\n",

Since the telegraph post is stationary, the time taken is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass by. So, the speed of each train can be calculated using the formula: speed = distance / time.\n",

When moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is 12 + 6 = 18 m/s. The total distance to cover is 120 + 120 = 240 m. Time = 240/18 ≈ 13.33 seconds, which rounds to 13 seconds.) # (Correct: b)\n",
      "Player 2 Explanation/Answer: (Explanation: The speed of the first train is distance/time = 120m/10s=12 m/s. Similarly, for second one it will be 120m/20s=6 m/s. When moving in opposite direction their relative velocity becomes sum of both speeds which equals to (12+6)=18 m/s. The total length they need to cross is twice the individual lengths as they're crossing each other completely =2*120m=240m. Time taken will be distance/relative speed, i.e., 240m / 18 m/s =13 seconds) #(Correct: b)\n",
